#  Predictive Modelling of Permitting Cost in Telecom Infrastructure Projects

## 🧩 Overview
This project builds a predictive model to estimate **permitting costs** in telecom infrastructure using econometric and regression analysis techniques.  
It applies data-driven insights to support better project budgeting, cost forecasting, and regulatory decision-making in the telecom sector.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- To identify the key factors influencing permitting costs.
- To develop an econometric model (OLS regression) for cost prediction.
- To validate the model using statistical tests and diagnostics.
- To support telecom firms in financial planning and risk management.



## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Telecom infrastructure project data (collected from regulatory records and internal datasets)
- Key Variables:  
  - `Project_Location`  
    
  - `Material_Cost`  
  - `Regulatory_Fee`  
  - `Project_Duration`  
  - `Permitting_Cost` *(Dependent Variable)*

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visual and statistical analysis of cost drivers.  
3. **Model Building** – Applying OLS regression using the `statsmodels` library.  
4. **Diagnostics** – Checking for heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and multicollinearity.  
5. **Validation** – Using R², Adjusted R², and residual analysis to test model performance.

## 📈 Results
- The model achieved a strong explanatory power .  
- Regulatory fees and material costs were found to be the most significant predictors.  
- Diagnostic tests confirmed model robustness and reliability.
