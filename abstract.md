# capstone abstract
The project tries to analyse how different factors are impacting the cost of permitting, such as land base expenses, aerial installation expenses, right-of-way charges, and other routing-associated expenses. The research is doing secondary data generated by AI, based on using websites of the associated telecom industry and fiber connection network. The project is finding the data of 20 countries and analysing and evaluating the permit cost of all the countries. The telecom infrastructure is subject to high permitting costs because of land conditions, regulatory agencies, and uncertain fees. In this project, we examine what the factors are that are actually impacted by the permitting cost. The research primarily employs regression modelling and descriptive statistics. Therefore, this project is highly beneficial for telecommunication companies, policymakers, and stakeholders who would like to analyse the permitting expense in terms of other factors, i.e., underground routing factors. This research is useful for knowledge and expense optimization.
